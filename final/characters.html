            <h1 class="heading_style" >Harry Potter</h1>
            <p> Harry is the main protagonist. He is orphaned as a baby when his parents, James and Lily Potter, are killed by Voldemort for resisting his attempted takeover of the wizarding world. As a final act of love, Lily protected Harry from Voldemort's curse, an act which saved his life but left him with a lightning-bolt-shaped scar on his forehead. When he arrives at Hogwarts, Harry is sorted into Gryffindor House. The events leading up to the Second Wizard War require him to constantly get into trouble with various authority figures, a trait he inherited from his father. Over the next seven years, he learns more about his parents', grows into an accomplished wizard, and defeats Voldemort.</p>
